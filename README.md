# This is a copy-work project with a goal of learning the javascript required a website I really liked. 
The site I used was https://hoynebrewing.ca/ 
Thank you hoynebrewing for such a great website to learn from!
I was aiming to build it quickly and focused more on the javascript than the css and responsive styles. The site is most viewable from 800 - 1400px.
You can find the live version of my app on https://jaysonpostle.digital/hoyne-brewing/

# Next steps/learning opportunities
The button and social icons I believe use an external paid library - more research is needed to get those implemented. 
I would like to improve my beer slide show to copy the "roulette wheel" like animation of the original. One where it decelarates as it gets closer to the end beer slide.
I was under a personal deadline to complete this project and my html should be cleaner than it is; however, my primary goal was to build a very close lookalike of the original site quickly and build the javascript functionality. 
Page scroll animations will be learnt next! :)
